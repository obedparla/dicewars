Play the Dice-Wars game against another player on the same computer.

I created this project as a way to learn React back in 2017. It works great, but it also shows a lot of rookie mistakes. I was also less experienced back then!

## Run the project

```
npm install
```

To run the game on development

```
npm run start
```

And to build the Scss into CSS

```
npm run watch-css
```
